# Pig Game [desktop version]
A dice game where players race to 100, risking it all on each roll!

The **Pig Game** gets its name from the animal "pig" because the gameplay involves risk-taking and greed, much like the stereotype of pigs being greedy for food. In the game, players roll a die to accumulate points, but if they roll a 1, they lose their turn and forfeit any points theyâ€™ve earned in that round. The challenge is to decide whether to "play it safe" and hold or to "be greedy" and roll again for a higher score.
